# Telephone-Directory
This is the source code in C++ for a telephone directory. I welcome every suggestions, propositions, tips or advice.

This program allows the user to navigate in the directory by giving the users these 4 options: 
-Search by name   - Show the whole list of contacts   -Change an existing numbers   - Add a new number in the directory.

**Note: The comments give a clear explanation for every line of code. 

Feel free to use this source code if you find it helpful . I love coding, I do this for fun - Thank me later!
